### About Myself

Hi, my name is Kira, I'm 27 years old.

For the last 5 years I've been working at a law firm. I am engaged in real estate transactions, interacting with government agencies, and controlling document circulation. I'm came up against a ceiling, there are no further growth prospects and simply I lost interest in this industry.

I decided to radically change the area of activity.

After analyzing my strengths:
Persistence (I do not stop until the task is solved)
self-learning ability
ability **to hear** colleagues
huge interest and, it seems to me, propensity for information technology industry,
the choice focused on programming, to begin with on Frontend development.

Also in this area, I am attracted by the lack of ceiling, the learning process never stops, constant brain storm.

I understand that I am on the very first step of my new career, so any experience is important to me.
I would like to develop side by side with the same enthusiastic people, in a friendly atmosphere.
